        <h1> I Really Love Cats </h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p> There are many reasons why these fur babies are held so close to my heart.
                Growing up, I always had cats in my life. My family has had probabaly 
                had a near dozen felines in the household. Each with unique
                personalities, coats, and memories, I will share some of my Favorite
                fur-iends of my childhood as well as some of my Favorite
                breeds.

            <h3> Top 3 Cat Breeds I like</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>American Short Hair Tabby</strong></li>
                <img src="ProjectImages/TabbyCat.jpg" alt="American ShortHair Tabby Kitten" width="20%"/>
                <p><em>Tabbies have an extra special place in my heart as my
                    most precious Sally girl was a tabby. We shared over 
                    16 years of bestie-ship together since I was 5 years old.
                    She brought me much comfort as a child in a troubled home, and
                    would even lick my tears when I cried. At 24, I got a tattoo
                    in her memory. She was the best. </em></p>
                     
                <li><strong>Ragdoll</strong></li>
                <img src="ProjectImages/Ragdoll.jpg" alt="White Ragdoll Cat" width="20%" />
                <p><em>I have never owned one, but Ragdoll cats have always captivated
                    me. I think they are so adorable and regal and have the prettiest eyes!
                </em></p>
                
                <li><strong>Maine Coone</strong></li>
                <img src="ProjectImages/MaineCoon.jpg" alt="Orange Maine Coon Cat" width="20%"/>
                <p><em>Another breed I have not had the pleasure of owning, but would love to.
                    Maine Coone cats are a large, super fluffy, breed. Owning one would 
                    be like having a dog and cat in one!</em>
            </ul>
