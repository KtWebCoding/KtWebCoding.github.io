        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am a student taking the Univeristy of Michigan Introduction to HTML 5 class on Coursera.
            This website is a test of my html coding skills thus far.
            <br>
            <em>How is it looking so far?</em>
        </p>
        <strong> Here are some of my favorite things:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Cats!</li>
            <img src = "Images/Cat.jpeg"/>
            <li>Pasta!</li>
            <img src = "Images/Pasta.jpeg"/>
            <li>Watching Desperate Housewives!</li>
            <img src = "Images/DesperateHouseWives.jpeg" />
        </ul>
        <p>How neat is that? I added some images into the code! 
            To think I knew absolutely nothing about html coding just yesterday!
